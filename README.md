## This is a basic encryption/decryption tool for ASCII characters.

-Before doing anything, insert or create a key.txt file
(when decrypting, this must match the key.txt file used to encrypt the text)

-Ensure you only use ASCII characters

-When using the local decryption option, paste encrypted text, press enter, and press ctrl+z then enter to properly input
your decrypted text.

-No errors messages programmed, must ensure proper use.

- Insert ` or ~ for tab or a linebreak at specific points, respectively

### READ:
- I do NOT recommend using the local decryptor. Windows console is limited to pasting 4096 characters, so unless you want
to paste your encrypted text 4096 characters at a time, use input.txt.
